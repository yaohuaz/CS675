This folder is to calculate the average error of least squares and hinge loss with adaptive eta (learning rate).

The learning rate, eta, range from 0.0001 to 0.00000000001.

lsq.py is for least squares loss function, and hinge loss is for SVM.

To perform the full calculation, run command:
perl run_lsq.pl ../ionosphere ./

Same for /breast_cancer folder and /qsar folder.
